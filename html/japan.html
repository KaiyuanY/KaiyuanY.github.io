		<p>
			Japan is situated in north eastern Asia between the North Pacific and the Sea of Japan. The area of Japan is 377,873 square kilometres, nearly equivalent to Germany and Switzerland combined or slightly smaller than California. With total population of 127 million, The Japan cover by four major islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu and surrounded by more than 4,000 smaller islands. Among the vibrant green of the mountains, amidst the fluttering cherry blossom petals, within the transition of the four seasons, people see colours. Within characters painstakingly written by brush, in Japanese-style homes fragrant of wood, in tableware that colours the dining table, people admire shapes. Japan’s colours and shapes are messages that convey spirit and culture

			<span>Cherry Blossoms</span><br>
			Warm temperatures caused the cherry blossom front to move up the Japanese archipelago at a record-breaking pace this year. The trees reached full bloom in Hakodate on April 24 and in Sapporo on April 26, almost two weeks earlier than average. While our annual reporting of the seasonal spectacle will end on April 30 in Sapporo, the cherry blossoms will continue to delight hanami-goers in more eastern and northern areas of Hokkaido and higher elevations of northeastern Japan for a couple more weeks.<br><br>
			Below are the actual and forecast dates of cherry trees opening their blossoms this year (according to the Japan Weather Association, except Yoshino which is according to Yoshino Town) and the estimated best viewing periods (estimated by japan-guide.com based on the aforementioned forecasts). Rain, wind and temperatures can have a strong effect on the process of the season, for example, they can accelerate, delay or shorten it considerably. Use the forecasts on your own risk.

			<span>Temples</span><br>
			Temples are the places of worship in Japanese Buddhism. Virtually every Japanese municipality has at least one temple, while large cultural centers like Kyoto have several thousands.<br>
			Temples store and display sacred Buddhist objects. Some temples used to be monasteries, and some still function as such.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span>Food and Drink</span><br>
			Japanese cuisine (和食, washoku) offers an abundance of gastronomical delights with a boundless variety of regional and seasonal dishes as well as international cuisine. Restaurants range from mobile food stands to centuries old ryotei, atmospheric drinking places, seasonally erected terraces over rivers, cheap chain shops and unique theme restaurants about ninja and robots. Many restaurants are specialized in a single type of dish, while others offer a variety of dishes.

			<span>Historic Sites</span><br>
			While many of Japan's historic buildings and districts have been lost due to fires, earthquakes, wars and city redevelopment over the centuries, some cities and towns have managed to preserve a street block or whole district of traditional buildings for residents and tourists to enjoy today. <br>
			Many Japanese cities, including Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, have developed as castle towns, where the local feudal lord resided in the centrally located castle, and his retainers, the samurai, lived in the districts surrounding the castle.<br>
			As the highest social caste during the Edo Period, the samurai were allowed to construct elaborate residences with earthen walls and elegant homes. Among the best preserved former samurai districts are the ones of Kakunodate, Hagi and Kanazawa.

			<span>Manga and Anime</span><br>
			Modern day manga (漫画) can be defined as comics corresponding to a Japanese style which originated during the mid-1900s. The popularity of manga in Japan has since ballooned. Today, there is a huge domestic industry for manga, and increasingly so internationally. In Japan, people of both genders and all ages read manga. For example, it is quite common to see business men in suits reading thick comic books in commuter trains.<br>
			The range of manga genres is diverse, with content ranging from history to futuristic science fiction and from teenage romance to profound themes about life. The comics are broadly separated into four categories according to the target audience: boys, girls, youths and matured. They can be commonly found in bookstores, bookstands and convenience stores all over Japan.<br>
			<div class="imgbox"><img class="contentimg" src="../img/anim.jpg" alt="animation"></img></div>
			A manga series may become popular enough that it is made into an anime (アニメ) - Japanese styled animation. Examples of world famous anime include "Dragonball", "Sailor Moon", "Pokemon" and "One Piece". Of course, original scripts may also be written for anime. One popular anime production company with its own distinct style is Studio Ghibli, which has produced award winning works such as "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Spirited Away".
