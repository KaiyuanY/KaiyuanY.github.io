			<span>League of Legends</span><br>
			League of Legends had a stunning growth over the video gaming market and is now one of the most played vedio game worldwide. Because it is a competitive esport, professional leagues (LPL, LCS, LCK, etc) have been set up across the world to foster professional players and also as a way to present audience from all over the world the excting professional competitive esport games.<br>
			I have been following professional games in league such as LPL and NA LCS. It is such a pleasure to watch the pro-player play with their high technique and reaction speed, as well as the art of teamwork.<br>

		<p><span>World Final</span><br>
			Here is a highlight vedio from last year's LOL World Championship in which Team SamSung White from Korea finally defeated Team Star Horn Royal Club from China and was titled to be the world champion of Season 4.
