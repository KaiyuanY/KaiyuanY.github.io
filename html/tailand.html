		<p>
			Thailand is the country in Southeast Asia most visited by tourists, and for good reason. You can find almost anything here: thick jungle as green as can be, crystal blue waters that feel more like a warm bath than a swim in the ocean, and food that can curl your nose hairs while dancing across your taste buds. Exotic, yet safe; cheap, yet equipped with every modern amenity you need, there is something for every interest and every price bracket, from beach front backpacker bungalows to some of the best luxury hotels in the world. And despite the heavy flow of tourism, Thailand retains its quintessential Thai-ness, with a culture and history all its own and a carefree people famed for their smiles and their fun-seeking sanuk lifestyle. Many travellers come to Thailand and extend their stay well beyond their original plans and others never find a reason to leave. Whatever your cup of tea, they know how to make it in Thailand.

			<span>Bankok</span><br><br>
			Bangkok is an exciting and vibrant city of over 12 million people. The greater metropolitan area of Bangkok extends for more than 32 kilometres (20 miles) in all directions. Situated in the central plains of Thailand, on the Chao Phraya River near the Gulf of Thailand, Bangkok is Thailand`s administrative, economic, and cultural centre, as well as a major commercial and transportation hub for South-east Asia.<br><br>
			You need not travel far in Bangkok to find the trappings of modern civilisation give way to historical treasures and traditional culture and heritage.<br><br>
			A rich history, fabulous shopping, colourful night life, sumptuous food and plenty of fun. Although Bangkok, one of the largest cities in the world is crowded, fast paced and rather polluted, you can easily find the traditional and spiritual side at one of the many ancient temples.<br><br>
			One visit to Bangkok is seldom enough. It is a city that will whet the appetite of those with an inquisitive nature and a thirst for adventure. There are unending contrasts around every corner, Bangkok is truly unique.<br><br>
			Despite the traffic congestion, its not hard to get around by using the BTS Skytrain, the MRT Metro (subway, or underground), the Chao Phrya Express Boats (river buses), and the ubiquitous colourful taxis. Check the Bangkok forum FAQs for more details.

			<span>Phuket Island</span><br><br>
			The largest island in Thailand, Phuket is a beautiful destination for sightseeing and adventuring. The island itself is rife with diverse landscapes, from its famous sandy beaches to forested hills, mountains, limestone cliffs, low plains, lagoons and lush tropical vegetation.<br><br>
			Patong Beach is the most popular and developed beach in Phuket. With its white sands and beautiful waters, this beach attracts families, couples and single travelers looking for a lively vacation in a hopping tourist spot. Jet skis, motor boats, vendors, sunbathers and tourists engaged in all kinds of water sports make this beach anything but tranquil. For a more relaxing visit you might enjoy the much quieter Kalim Bay to the north of Patong.<br><br>
			The beaches of the south coast of Phuket are very popular with tourists, with their fine white sand beaches and lush vegetation that stretches up from the coast to the nearby mountains. Between Relax Bay in the west and Cape Panwa in the east, this coast includes some of the most idyllic stretches of beach in the world.<br><br>
			The beaches of the north coast are by far more tranquil than those of the south. Visitors with a desire for a tranquil tropical vaction will enjoy the unspoiled beaches and rugged beauty of this region. Majestic casuarinas form natural parasols that provide a reprive from the heat of the sun.<br><br>
			Surin, Bangtao, and Layan beach, in the north west, are all lovely beaches.  They are much less developed, more spacious, relaxed and romantic, better for couples and young families. <br><br>
			With instruction and equipment available at many of the major beaches, activities such as diving and snorkeling are vastly popular in Phuket. Even if you have never gone scuba diving, this is a beautiful place to learn. Sailing, wind surfing and sea canoeing are also exciting and popular choices. Swimming is also very popular, but not recommended during monsoon season. Make sure to observe the warnings on the beaches. If the red flag is flying, donâ€™t go in! Even with such observations to keep in mind, there is no shortage of seaside activities for the adventurous traveler in Phuket.
